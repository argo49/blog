Some interesting resources for learning how to become a better engineering manager. It's not comprehensive, I'm sure I'm leaving things out. Also, 
I don't necessarily agree with all of the management styles or opinions these resources have, but it's nice to get different sides of the similar issues.

## Blogs / Publications

* [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/)
* [charity.wtf](https://charity.wtf/)
* [The Looking Glass](https://lg.substack.com/)
* [Increment](https://increment.com/) (occasionally)

## Books

You might have already heard of some of these, but I'll post them anyway. Trying to limit it to books I've actually read and think might be worth reading:
* The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier
* The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz
* The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek
* The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle (not great for remote work environments tho)
* The Making of a Manager by Julie Zhuo
