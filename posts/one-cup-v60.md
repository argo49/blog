## Ingredients

* 360g soft, filtered water, freshly boiled (for lighter roasts)
* 21.6g of medium-fine ground light roast coffee

## Instructions

### Setup
* Pre-heat the v60 and filter with hot/boiling water
    * If you place the v60 on a flat surface (bottom of sink) you can use less boiling water since it will slow the exit of the water
* Make a small divet in the center of the grounds

* 1m00s - 1m10s: Pause
* 1m10s - 1m20s: Pour up to 216g total (60% total weight)

* 1m50s - 2m00s: Pour up to 360g total (100% total weight)
