Here's a link to the [original lower-fat chocolate chip cookies recipe](https://www.dinnerwithjulie.com/2009/04/18/lower-fat-chocolate-chip-cookies/).

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 2 Tbsp. maple syrup
* 2 tsp. vanilla or maple extract
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/3 cup chocolate chips
* 1/3 cup pistachios

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. In a large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar until well combined — the mixture will have the consistency of wet sand.
3. Add egg, maple syrup and vanilla and beat until smooth.
4. Add the flour, baking soda and salt and stir until almost combined.
5. Add chocolate chips and pistachios and stir just until blended. It may seem dry at this point - I always find it easiest to get in there with my hands toward the end.
6. Grease cookie sheet with a stick of butter.
7. Drop balls of dough (40-50g each) onto the sheet. Flatten slightly with your hand.
8. Bake for 12 minutes.
