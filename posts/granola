A recipe for granola that I've been working on that is hopefully healthy and delicious.

Here's a link to the [original recipe](https://cookieandkate.com/healthy-granola-recipe/).

## Ingredients
* [4.00 cup] Rolled oats
* [0.75 cup] Raw nuts and/or seeds and/or coconut flakes
* [1.00 tsp] Salt
* [0.33 cup] Melted coconut oil
* [0.50 tsp] Ground cinnamon
* [0.33 cup] Maple syrup
* [1.00 tsp] Vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, nuts and/or seeds, salt and cinnamon. Stir to blend.
3. Pour in the oil, maple syrup and vanilla. Mix well, until every oat and nut is lightly coated. 
4. Pour the granola onto your prepared pan and use a large spoon to spread it in an even layer.
5. Bake until lightly golden, about 21 to 24 minutes, stirring halfway 
6. Let the granola cool completely, undisturbed (at least 45 minutes). 
7. Break the granola into pieces with your hands if you want to retain big chunks, or stir it around with a spoon if you donâ€™t want extra-clumpy granola.
8. Store the granola in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks, or in a sealed freezer bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.
