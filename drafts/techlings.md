You've seen them everywhere, on all of your favorite apps and websites. Smiling pastel people doing things that normal people do I swear I saw it in a movie once. The lifeless eyes (when they have them) tell you what already know to be true. These grotesque charicatures literally only want one thing and it's disgusting- they want your money.

[Facebook]() has them. has them. They drip from accounts on dribbble at a pace that's quickly turning into a stream. The new stock photo craze is brand-centric and unique. Design principles and rule dictate their style and while each company tries to turn it into something memorable, they all turn into a blur of vaguely human shaped colors working together to do something related to whatever product you're signing up for.
